Ques 1: Important feature of Java8:
1.Java is platform independent.
2.It is secure language.
3.Robust
Ques2.JVM: It stands for java virtual machine. JVM is used to run the byte code.
JVM are available in many hardware and software platform .
JVM provides the runtime environment.
JVM is a platform dependent .
Ques 3: Java Lang is super class of all the classes.
Ques 4: Java does not support multiple inheritance because one class cannot inherited two different classes .

Ques 5:Java is not pure object orientated language beacuse in java all methods are called with the help of object.

Ques6: Overloading method:
In overloading method , name of method are same but parameter are different.
Overriding Method:
In overriding method, name of method and paramertised value are same.
No, we cannot overload the main method.

Ques7: Access specifier :
1.Public : Public is accessible by all fields and classes.
2 Private :Private is accessible within the class.
3Protected: Protected is accessible by only derived classess.
difference between access specifier and access modifier is access specifier declares value to the variable and access modifier changes value .

Ques 8JVM: It stands for java virtual machine. It provides runtime environment . JVM executes byte code .
JRE:It stands java runtime environment . It contains set of liabries and JVM tools.
JDK:It stands for java development kit. It contains jre and development tools.
jvm,jre,jdk are platform dependent beacuse configuration of each OS differ.

Ques9:Static keyword: In static keyword, there is no need to create a object it will automatically call the function.
Final keyword: In final keyword, you have to intilize the value of variable. In this, we can't change value once you intilize .

Ques 11:Abstract class:Abstract class is used to hide data . in this ,it shows functionality to the user.
Interface: Interface is like empty cell .it is used to inherit more than one class.

Ques12:Super: Super is keyword that is used to call the base class.
this:Pointing the class member.
Garbage collector: Heap memory for an object to reclaimed by automatic memory managment is known as garbage collector.Heap memory size may be sized,
expaned and shrunk depend upon the garbage collector strategy .

Program: write a program to print triangle.
package AbstractClass;

public class Pattern {
	int i,j,k=5;
	public void acc(){
		for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){
			for(int j=1;j<k;j++){
			System.out.print(" ");
			}
			k=k-1;
			for(int j=1;j<=i;j++){
				System.out.print("* ");
			}
			System.out.println();
		}

	}
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Pattern oo =new Pattern();
		oo.acc();
		
			
	}

}
Program:Write a program in duplicate element of an array.
package AbstractClass;

public class Duplicate {
	int num[]={2,4,4,7};
	public void check(){
		for(int i=0;i<num.length;i++){
			for(int j=0;j<i;j++){
				if (num[i]==num[j])
						{
					System.out.println("duplicate value is:"+num[j]);	
						}
				
			}
			
		}
		
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Duplicate oo=new Duplicate();
		oo.check();
		
		
	}

}
